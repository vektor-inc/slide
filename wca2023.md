Block theme X-T9 released<br>
Currently in trial and error for block theme

<div class="telop telop--left" style="bottom:1em;">
In addition, development and sales of other plug-ins

## Business model of theme authors<br>( Before full site editing )

* Theme sales (Classic)
* Selling plugins of theme function extension
* Selling plugins of extension block ... etc.
<div class="hidden">
*  ( Undertake customizing own themes. )

Simply create a theme → Sell zip file
Relatively possible to sell and make money.

Theme authors can also undertake customizing their own themes, 
but that is not the purpose of this session, 
so I won't go into that.

Points where monetization has become more difficult than before

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# # 01
# Traditional monetization points become less effective


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Before Full Site Editting

User want to change
<div class="list-icon">

<i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>Display element of the header
<i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>Layout of my site
<i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i>Fonts and colors ... etc

<i class="fa-regular fa-face-frown"></i> Users who don't understand code and CSS can't customize as desired.<br>
</div>

<!-- 
Before FSE

For example
user want to change

* Display element of the header
* Layout of own site
* Fonts and colors ... etc

But users who don't understand code and CSS 
can't customize as desired.
-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theme authors
develop themes with unique editing functions
and sell Premium themes

<div class="row colmuns" style="margin-top:30px">

<!-- 
Therefore, 
theme authors develop themes with unique editing functions,
and sell Premium themes

User can easily edit,
Theme authors get paid

Such a relationship existed and
there was one monetization point here
-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Era of Full Site Editing

The entire site can be customized with no code!

* Header and footer layout
* Specify color and font size
* Margin / Padding / Gap settings ...etc

<i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Much less theme dependent.

<!-- 
However, in FSE,

* Header and footer layout
* Specify color and font size
* Margin / Padding / Gap settings ...etc

Users can customize entire site with no code, 
just standard WordPress features.

This makes it much less dependent on the theme.

The area that theme developers have focused on for monetization is greatly influenced by full site editing.

# How add value and differentiate?

<div class="bg-kao bg-kao--right" style="bottom:50px;font-size:150px !important;">
（・ｗ・？
</div>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Differentiation by block pattern

#### <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i> Easiest way

Selling themes and plugins that include various block patterns

Header / Footer / Contents etc.

<span class="hidden">I think most theme developers are already working on these.
</span>

<div class="alert alert-warning text-center">
There is nothing that users cannot create on their own, <br>so it is weak as a point of monetization.
</div>

<!-- 
First, 
we can consider differentiation by block pattern

As the easiest way

Selling themes and plugins that include various block patterns

Various Header , Footer , and Contents patterns

However, as mentioned earlier

There is nothing that users cannot create on their own, 
so it is weak as a point of monetization.
-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
![bg right:20%](images/global-style.png)


## Differentiation by Global Styles variations

#### <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i> New Easiest way

“Global Styles variations” Feature Introduced in WordPress 6.0

We can create different variations within a single theme.

<!-- 
The second is 
differentiation by Global Styles variations.

"Global Style Variations" is a feature introduced in WordPress 6.0

This feature allows you to create different variations within a single theme.
-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Block Patterns / Global Style Variations

Even general users can make it, but...

* High quality products created by professional designers
→ High added value of course
</span>

<div class="alert alert-success text-center">
<i class="fa-regular fa-thumbs-up"></i> New extensibility and monetization points.

## Our case

#### Publish our own Block Pattern Directory

https://patterns.vektor-inc.co.jp/

<i class="fa-solid fa-language"></i>Only available in Japanese

（Inspired by the Org site: https://wordpress.org/patterns/)

<span class="hidden">

<!-- 
Our case

We published our own block pattern directory

This is a site similar to the official pattern directory, 
where user can copy and use block patterns.

### Why we created our own pattern directory?

<div class="bg-kao bg-kao--right" style="bottom:50px;font-size:150px !important;">

</div>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Still difficult only with core blocks

Want to use our original blocks and CSS 
to provide higher quality patterns

<div class="alert alert-warning mt-20">
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i> .org allowed only core blocks and can't use Custom CSS.
</div>

<!-- 
Because
Still difficult only with core blocks,
so
I wanted to use my own original blocks 
to provide more practical patterns.

### 1. Premium patterns

<!-- 
At first

### 2. Favorite pattern registration function

Patterns are added one after another
→ hard to find

Function to register own favorite patterns

※ Same functionality as wordpress.org

<!-- 
Second

Favorite pattern registration function

Patterns are added one after another 
so become hard to find

Therefore

This function allows users to register own favorite patterns 
and easily recall them.

This is same functionality as wordpress.org
-->

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Link function for favorite registered patterns

Call patterns registered in favorites from the user's site with API

Users can use it directly from the edit screen of their site

<div class="text-center">[ image screen capture or fig ]</div>

<!-- 
3rd benefit is
Link function for favorite registered patterns

Call patterns registered in favorites from the user's site with API

then

Users can use it directly from the edit screen of their site

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is a value-added pattern?

Creating and developing more patterns has become very important for developers who were in the theme sales business.

Where is the added value that is the key to monetization?

## Localization is essential

When providing as a pattern for the entire page 
including sentences

* Must be in the language of the country
* A design optimized for each language (characters/typefaces) is better
* Content and design trends vary by region (country)

<i class="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>With localized versions, no competition with English-speaking developers.

but not everyone can create high-quality designs meet their purpose, right?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Responsive design compatibility

How to control display elements according to screen size?

With a single screen width, it might be possible to lay out well somehow.
However, when it comes to layout on multiple widths, it's actually not that easy.
