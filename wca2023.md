## Differentiation by block pattern

#### <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i> Easiest way

Selling themes and plugins that include various block patterns

Header / Footer / Contents etc.

<span class="hidden">I think most theme developers are already working on these.

<div class="alert alert-warning text-center">
There is nothing that users cannot create on their own, <br>so it is weak as a point of monetization.

<!-- 
First, 
we can consider differentiation by block pattern

As the easiest way

Selling themes and plugins that include various block patterns

Various Header , Footer , and Contents patterns

However, as mentioned earlier

There is nothing that users cannot create on their own, 
so it is weak as a point of monetization.

## What is a value-added pattern?

Creating and developing more patterns has become very important for developers who were in the theme sales business.

Where is the added value that is the key to monetization?

When providing as a pattern for the entire page

* Must be in the language of the country
* A design optimized for each language (characters/typefaces) is better
* Content and design trends vary by region (country)
