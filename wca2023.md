like me,
Business model of theme authors is

Create and sell

I think these were the mainstream.

We could simply create a theme and sell it as a zip file.
It was relatively possible to sell and make money.

High quality products created by profesional designers

## Our case

#### Publish our own Block Pattern Directory

https://patterns.vektor-inc.co.jp/

<i class="fa-solid fa-language"></i>Only available in Japanese

Inspired by the Org site:
https://wordpress.org/patterns/


<!-- 
Our case

We published our own block pattern directory

### Why we created our own pattern directory?

（・ｗ・

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Still difficult only with core blocks

Want to use our original blocks and CSS 
to provide higher quality patterns

<div class="alert alert-warning mt-24">
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i> .org allowed <b class="text-danger">only core blocks</b> and <b class="text-danger">can't use Custom CSS</b>.

<!-- 
Because
Still difficult only with core blocks,
so
I wanted to use my own original blocks 
to provide more practical patterns.

Practical Patterns can be motivates people to purchase Premium Patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.  language problem

### 2. Favorite pattern registration function

Function to register own favorite patterns

※ Same functionality as wordpress.org

<!--

Patterns are added one after another

## What is a value-added pattern?

Creating and developing more patterns has become very important for developers who were in the theme sales business.

Where is the added value that is the key to monetization?
